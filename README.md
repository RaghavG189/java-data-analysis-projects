# 🧰 Java Coursework Projects

This repository contains selected Java programming assignments completed as part of my coursework at Rutgers University for Data Structures and related classes. Each project demonstrates core programming skills, including logic development, conditionals, loops, and working with structured data.

## 🗂 Contents

### 📁 RUHungry
A console-based program that helps users decide what to eat based on preferences. Focus: input handling, filtering logic.

### 📁 ForensicAnalysis
A string processing program that simulates forensic DNA analysis to identify suspects. Focus: string matching, iteration.

### 📁 StopAndFrisk
Analyzes mock stop-and-frisk data to output summaries by demographics. Focus: data analysis, conditionals, nested loops.

## 🛠 Skills Demonstrated
- Java programming
- Input/output via console
- Conditional logic
- Loops and iteration
- Basic data analysis
- Modular code and functions

## 📌 Note
These projects were based on provided starter templates created by Computer Science staff. All core logic and implementation was done by me.
